Kids' 24" Bikes
===============

This repository is some python and R code I wrote to make comparisons between different kids' bikes that are available in North America this year. 

The raw data for the bikes is located in a google sheet at: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FodMz3A9-ehyC2bdrjs72kN5OgBBWe_H9EtYCfVpBu0/edit?pli=1#gid=1960608829
