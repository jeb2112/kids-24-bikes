  <meta content="Freedom is the absence of fear. And riding fearlessly requires a bike that can handle your kid’s imagination. It’s why we designed Riprock to be a mountain bike inclusive of all the features needed for superior ripping, like modern geometry, Ground Control tires, hydraulic disc brakes, and internally routed cables. Finally, we threw in a wider-range drivetrain, making Riprock truly the perfect bike to inspire riders to climb higher and tackle the downhills freely. Kids can’t ride confidently if they’re not riding comfortably. With Riprock, fit comes first. This meant using data to reimagine everything from how they grip to how they sit to create a bike specifically and proportionally for kids. We did all this because comfort creates confidence. And more confidence always leads to more riding fearlessly." name="description"/>
